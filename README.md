# Deep learning reading group

A repository to keep track of papers in the reading group at University of Oslo.

Comments to the papers can be found under Issues. 

# Sessions

## #1: 12.02.16  
Papers: 
- A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing (http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf)

Suggested reading: Natural Language Understanding with Distributed Representation (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07916v1.pdf) (Ch. 1-3, 5 and perhaps 7).

## #2: 24.02.16 
Papers: 
- Natural Language Understanding with Distributed Representation (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07916v1.pdf)

Suggested reading: I also recommend the following two blog posts, they are both very good introductions to RNN and LSTM models.
